# SAP UI5 Demo Shell Control As Container

The Shell Container is a key component in SAPUI5 that provides a common frame for applications, making them look and feel consistent within the SAP ecosystem. 


Refer to [/webapp/view/App.view.xml](https://github.com/VaibhavMojidra/SAP-UI5---Demo-Shell-Control-As-Container/blob/master/webapp/view/App.view.xml "App.view.xml")

The shell control is now the outermost control of our app and automatically displays a so-called letterbox, if the screen size is larger than a certain width.

**Note**:  We don't add the Shell control to the declarative UI definition in the XML view if apps run in an external shell, like the SAP Fiori launchpad that already has a shell around the component UI.
